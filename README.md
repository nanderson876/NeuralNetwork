When completed, this program will take 3 inputs: 2 integer values between 0 and 99, and a char that is either '+' or '-'.

By either training or through uploading pre-trained weights through a file, the program will improve itself until it is able to correctly answer this type of problem

This is my first neural network project that wasn't guided by a video series, so if anyone ever stumbles upon this then any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated.
