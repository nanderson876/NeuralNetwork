This program creates an abstract NeuralNetwork class to simplify the creation of more specific and detailed single-layer neural networks.

Things I currently plan on adding evenutally:

- Multi-layer compatability
- More general inputs (different data types other than just doubles)

This is my first neural network project that wasn't guided by a video series, so if anyone ever stumbles upon this then any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated.
